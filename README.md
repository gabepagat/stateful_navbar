# stateful_navbar

A clone of the Flutter Material 3 [Navigation Bar example](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/NavigationBar-class.html#material.NavigationBar.2), 
using [go_router](https://pub.dev/packages/go_router) and stateful nested navigation (i.e. `StatefulShellRoute`) for the main navigation shell.

Currently this sample requires [PR #2650](https://github.com/flutter/packages/pull/2650) of go_router
(or [https://github.com/tolo/flutter_packages/tree/nested-persistent-navigation](https://github.com/tolo/flutter_packages/tree/nested-persistent-navigation)).
